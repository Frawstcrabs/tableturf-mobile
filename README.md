# Tableturf Mobile

A remake of Tableturf Battle in Flutter, designed for mobile devices. Also works on web.

Contains all official opponents/cards/maps of the original game, a deck builder, a custom map editor, and an AI to play against with multiple difficulties.

Use `flutter run` to run on a device.

## Todo list

- [ ] Make the UI less shit/better able to handle different screen sizes
- [ ] Screen for testing custom decks/boards
- [ ] Custom card creator
- [ ] XP system/some kinda progression
- [ ] Move all animation durations into a single global list of constants
- [ ] Multiplayer
